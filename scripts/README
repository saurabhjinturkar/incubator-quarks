Scripts for running the samples.

The source code for the samples is in the <edgent-release>/samples directory.

The samples can be run via by their run*.sh
shell scripts from this directory.  e.g.,

$ ./runhelloedgent.sh

Note: On Windows, use an environment like Cygwin 
to run these linux shell scripts.

See the README files in the connectors directory
for information about running those samples.
